#+TITLE: ESS Drag and Drop
#+AUTHOR: Matthew L. Fidler
* Introduction
I would like to drag files onto a ESS buffer and write the appropriate
code.  Enter ESS-drag and drop.
* Installation
To install, put the =ess-dnd.el= somewhere in your load path, and add
the following lines to your startup file, usually =~/.emacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ess-dnd)
(ess-drag-and-drop-activate)
#+END_SRC
* Status and Future
Currently it only supports R and CSV files but it is customizable.  If
you have any generally useful code snippes you would like to add, let
me know or send a pull request.
